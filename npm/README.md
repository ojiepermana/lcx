If you are not using proxmox or want to install this on a existing Alpine box, you can run the setup script itself.

***Note:*** _Only Alpine, Debian and Ubuntu are currently supported by this script_

```bash
wget --no-cache -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ojiepermana/lcx/main/npm/install.sh | sh
```
